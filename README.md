# AI-Learning-Journey
A curated portfolio showcasing my journey in artificial intelligence and machine learning. This repository contains a collection of projects demonstrating my skills in areas like natural language processing, computer vision, and data analysis.

## Recent Activities (as of 2025-09-02)
- Completed and debugged exercises in the NLP Auto-Complete assignment (`000_Assignments`).
- Enhanced the Exploratory Data Analysis of FRED economic data, adding more descriptive text and exploring new data points like CPI for inflation (`001_Data_Analysis`).
- Updated the `002_NLP` project documentation to include details on the IMDb Sentiment Analysis with TensorFlow notebook and restructured the README to focus on NLP projects.
- Added and updated documentation across the project.

## Projects

### [000_Assignments: NLP Auto-Complete](./000_Assignments/)

This project involves building a prototype of an auto-complete system using N-gram language models. It's an assignment from Coursera's "Natural Language Processing with Probabilistic Models" course.

**Key Features:**
- Text preprocessing and tokenization.
- N-gram counting and probability estimation.
- Perplexity calculation for model evaluation.

**Technologies Used:** Python, NLTK, Pandas, NumPy

### [001_Data_Analysis: Roller Coaster, Netflix & FRED EDA](./001_Data_Analysis/)

An exploratory data analysis (EDA) of three datasets: roller coasters, Netflix movies, and FRED economic data. This project involves data cleaning, preparation, and visualization to uncover insights.

**Key Findings (FRED Economic Data):**
- The S&P 500 index shows significant growth over time, with notable fluctuations during economic events.
- The national unemployment rate exhibits cyclical patterns, with sharp increases during recessions.
- State-level unemployment data reveals regional disparities in economic performance, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, fredapi, Plotly

### [002_NLP: Natural Language Processing Projects](./002_NLP/) (In Progress)

This folder contains various Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects, including a voice assistant and a sentiment analysis model.

**Key Projects:**
- **IMDb Sentiment Analysis with TensorFlow:** A Jupyter Notebook demonstrating sentiment analysis on movie reviews, covering data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.
- **Python Voice Assistant:** A simple voice-controlled assistant capable of recognizing voice commands and performing basic tasks.

**Technologies Used:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SpeechRecognition, pyttsx3, PyAudio
