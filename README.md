## Projects

### [001_Data_Analysis: Roller Coaster & Netflix EDA](./001_Data_Analysis/)

An exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a roller coaster dataset and a Netflix dataset. This project involves data cleaning, preparation, and visualization to uncover insights about roller coasters and movies on Netflix.
