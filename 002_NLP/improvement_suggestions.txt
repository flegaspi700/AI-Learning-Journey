Here are a few suggestions for improving the Chatbot.py script:

### 1. Make it an Interactive Chat (Terminal)

Instead of using a fixed list of questions, you can modify the script to accept live input from the user in the terminal. This is the most direct improvement.

- **How:** Wrap the chat logic in a `while True` loop that waits for the user to type a question.
- **Benefit:** Turns your script from a one-off execution into a real, continuous conversation.

### 2. Add Voice Capabilities

Given the folder name `002_Voice_Assistant`, a natural evolution is to add voice.

- **Speech-to-Text:** Use a library like `SpeechRecognition` to capture your voice from a microphone and turn it into text to send to the Gemini API.
- **Text-to-Speech:** Use a library like `gTTS` (Google Text-to-Speech) to have the assistant speak its responses back to you.
- **Benefit:** Creates a genuine voice assistant, as the project name implies.

### 3. Build a Simple Web UI with Flask

You can create a simple web page with a chat box that anyone with a browser can use.

- **How:** Use **Flask**, a lightweight Python web framework.
    1.  Create a simple HTML page with a text input and a chat history display.
    2.  Create a Flask backend that serves the HTML page.
    3.  Create an API endpoint in Flask that your webpage can send messages to. This endpoint will call the Gemini API and return the response.
- **Benefit:** Makes your chatbot accessible to non-technical users and gives it a professional feel.

### 4. Stream the Response

For a better user experience, you can "stream" the response from the model. Instead of waiting for the entire message to be generated, words will appear one by one as they are created.

- **How:** The Gemini API supports streaming. You would change `chat.send_message(question)` to `chat.send_message(question, stream=True)` and loop through the chunks of the response.
- **Benefit:** The application feels much more responsive and "alive."
